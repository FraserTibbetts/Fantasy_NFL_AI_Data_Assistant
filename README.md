# Fantasy-Football-AI-Data-Assistant
This project provides tools to help fantasy football managers optimize their teams using real player data and linear programming. Uses openai and tool calling to create a chat based assistant to help optimize your fantasy football team. The goal is to maximize projected scores based on league-specific scoring systems while adhering to lineup constraints. The code integrates NFL data to evaluate player performance and predict future scores.
